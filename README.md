# 🌿 Mental Health Prediction

## 📝 Overview  
This project aims to develop a **Self-Analysis Mental Health Model** to predict mental health conditions based on user-provided symptoms. Built using **machine learning techniques**, the model emphasizes **accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency**.  

---

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset used is the **Mental Health in Tech Survey**, which includes responses related to mental health conditions, workplace environments, and demographic details.

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing  
To ensure high data quality, the following preprocessing steps were applied:  

- ✅ **Handling Missing Values** – Imputed or removed missing data.  
- ✅ **Encoding Categorical Variables** – Used label encoding for categorical features.  
- ✅ **Feature Scaling** – Standardized numerical features for consistency.  
- ✅ **Feature Selection** – Removed irrelevant/redundant features.  
- ✅ **Train-Test Split** – Divided the dataset into training and testing sets.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used  
The following models were trained and evaluated:  

- 🔹 **Logistic Regression** (Final Model) ✅  
- 🔹 Random Forest Classifier  
- 🔹 Neural Network  

📌 **Why Logistic Regression?**  
- Balanced accuracy and interpretability.  
- Suitable for binary classification tasks.

## 📈 Model Evaluation  
Each model was assessed using:  

- 📌 **Accuracy** – Overall performance.  
- 📌 **Precision, Recall, & F1-score** – Performance on positive/negative cases.  
- 📌 **Confusion Matrix** – Breakdown of correct vs. incorrect predictions.  
- 📌 **ROC-AUC Score** – Classification effectiveness.
